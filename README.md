# Performance-Evaluation-of-Convolution-Layer-for-FPGA

Efficient implementation of convolution layers on FPGAs is vital for enhancing deep learning system performance. This project examines three operational scenarios: sequential processing without DSPs, sequential processing with DSP integration, and a novel approach delaying max pooling to accelerate convolution. The study balances resource utilization across DSPs, LUTs, and flip-flops while addressing inefficiencies. Recommendations include optimization and parallelization to improve processing time and resource utilization, offering actionable insights for advancing convolution efficiency on FPGAs.
